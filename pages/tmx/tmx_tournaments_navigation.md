The Tournament Calendar is displayed by clicking the Tournament Icon on the home screen.  If the Search Box is in Tournaments Mode, clicking the Tournament Count also displays the Tournament Calendar.

{% include image.html file="ch_tournament_calendar.png" alt="Tournament Calendar" caption="Tournament Calendar" %}

Tournaments which have not yet started or which are active are depicted in <font color='blue'>Blue</font>, while tournaments which have completed are <font color='gray'>Gray</font>. __Bold__ indicates that a tournament record has been downloaded from the CourtHive server.

Tournaments can be filtered by __date__ or __category__.  By default, the calendar displays tournaments from the current day through the end of the current month.  Any changes made to the calendar filters are retained until the browser is reloaded.

## Defining a Date Range

Click on the __From:__ or __To:__ dates to launch the [Pikaday Datepicker](https://github.com/dbushell/Pikaday).

The datepicker supports arrow-key navigation.  Dates may also be entered in the input box using YYYY-MM-DD format.

{% include tip.html content="Quickly modify __month__ or __year__ by clicking and selecting from drop down menus." %}
