## Editing Tournaments

Before a tournament may be edited it must be present in the [Tournaments Calendar.](tmx_tournaments_navigation.html) Refer to the section on [Adding Tournaments](tmx_tournaments_management.html#manually-adding-tournaments) if there are no tournaments in the calendar.

When a tournament is selected from the calendar a modal window displays the tournament information in read-only mode.

To edit a tournament you must be part of the same organization that created the tournament.  If this is the case, a __Pencil Icon__ appears in the upper right-hand corner.

Once in __Editing Mode__ a number of other tabs and options become available, and the tournament information fields become editable.

To exit __Editing Mode__, click on the __Check Mark__ in the upper right hand corner.

## Downloading Tournaments

In the center of the tournament panel there is a __Cloud Download__ icon.  Clicking this icon will retrieve a version of the current tournament from the [CourtHive Cloud Server.](tmx_cloud_server.html)

If no version of the current tournament has been pushed to the server, an error message is shown.

{% include image.html file="ch_cloudfetch_replace_tournament.png" alt="Replace Tournament" caption="Replace Tournament" %}

The [Tournament Information](tmx_tournament_information.html) section describes how to push copies of a tournament to the  [CourtHive Cloud Server.](tmx_cloud_server.html)
