Once draws have been completed they become available for scoring.

Scores can be entered directly into Draws and Brackets, on the [Matches Tab](tmx_tournament_matches.html), or in the [Schedule](tmx_tournament_schedule.html).

## Elimination Draws

When Elimination Draws are complete, the matches which may be scored are highlighed.

## Round Robin Brackets

Positions which may be scored are highlighed in blue when the mouse hovers over them.

Positions which are invalid for scoring because of __Byes__ are colored light yellow.

## Score Entry

The method of score entry is the same for all events.

Active selectors are __white__ and are used to enter the number of games won by each player.

### Scoring Format
To change scoring for an single match, click the icon in the upper right hand corner to toggle __Scoring Configuration__.

### Auto Completion

Only a single value needs to be provided for each set, the lower number of __Games Won__.

{% include image.html file="ch_scoring_games.png" alt="Scoring Games" caption="Scoring Games" %}

The complementary value is calculated automatically and scoring advances to the next set, if the match is incomplete.

### Modifying Set Scores

If the score for a set needs to be modified, clicking on either of the players' scores takes the focus back to that set.

### Incomplete Matches, Retirements, Walkovers and Defaults

Clicking on the green __dash__ "-" to the right of the set scores presents options for completing the match scoring by Retirement, Walkover, or Default, as well as the option to mark a match as Interrupted or "Live".

### Accepting Match Scores

When scoring is complete the __"Accept"__ button sumbmits the score.

### Editing Match Scores

Match scores may be edited by clicking on __existing scores__.

When a match has been completed, scoring for subsequent matches is enabled.

### Removing Matches

Match results can be removed from a Draw or Bracket by [Context Clicking](tmx_fundamentals.html).

Match results are also removed when scoring is _cleared_ in the scoring dialogue.

### Tiebreak Scores

Entry of tiebreak scores is similar to entering set scores except that an entry field is used instead of a selector.

{% include image.html file="ch_scoring_tiebreak.png" alt="Tiebreak Score" caption="Tiebreak Score" %}

{% include important.html content='Since entry fields are used for tiebreak scores the __Enter/Return__ key _must_ be pressed to complete scoring.' %}
