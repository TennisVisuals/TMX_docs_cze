The CourtHive/TMX search box can be used to search for Players, Tournaments, or Clubs.  

{% include important.html content="If diacritics are __not__ enabled in [settings](tmx_setup.html) settings then use, for example, 'S' instead of 'Å '." %}

{% include tip.html content="To change the Search Mode, click on the Magnifying Glass in the Search Box." %}

The icon to the right of the search box is dependent on the mode of the search box and displays the number of Players, Tournaments, or Clubs that have been saved to the local database.

The default behavior of the search box is to find players, and the default search order is First Name / Last Name.  You can change the search order by Right or Control Clicking in the search box.

When editing a tournament the search box can change its behavior.  During Player Sign-In it is used to Add players who are not previously registered, or to Sign-In (and Sign-out) registered players.  When creating events, the search box is used to Approve players and to build doubles teams.

More information about these search box behaviors can be found in the corresponding sections of the documentation.
