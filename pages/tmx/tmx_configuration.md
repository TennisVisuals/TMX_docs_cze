Configuration Keys come in two varieties:
* __Organization keys:__ provided to organizations which have validated CourtHive for use in their tournaments.  
* __Authorization Keys:__ generated by Organization Administrators and are single-use

Both types of keys are entered using the Keys Dialogue, which is accessed by clicking on the __Keys Icon__ from the Home page.

{% include image.html file="ch_enter_key.png" alt="Enter Configuration Key" caption="Enter Configuration Key" %}

{% include important.html content="Keys must be typed or copied and pasted into the input field and the __Submit__ button must be clicked (or the Enter/Return key must be pressed) for the key to take effect." %}

{% include tip.html content="The Keyboard Shortcuts for Copy/Paste are Command-C/Command-V (Mac) and Control-C/Control-V (Windows)" %}

Keys can determine defaults for end-user settings as well as encode organization-specific regulations with respect to how tournament draws may be created and how data may be exchanged with other systems. Keys can also enable or disable features of the system and differentiate roles within an organization, such as Referee or Administrator.

{% include note.html content='Unless a Configuration Key is "single-use", it is stored as an "Existing" key in the local database.  If an organization makes changes to its default configuration, or if a referee needs to switch between two different organizations, stored keys may be reloaded.' %}
