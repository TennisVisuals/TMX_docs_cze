## CourtHive/TMX makes extensive use of "Context" menus

* Context Menus are accessed by Right Clicking (Windows) or Control Clicking (Mac).
* Example: The icon for publishing can be used to 'un-publish' a draw or a schedule.
* Example: Clicking on an incomplete match in a draw will launch a scoring dialogue, while Context Clicking the same location offers the option to remove the match.

## Other Uses of Context Clicking:
* Nominating Wildcards in Event Creation
* Swapping Player Positions in Draws
* Determining Alternates in Draws
* Deleting or Merging Tournaments in Calendar
* Providing Scheduling Details and Match Start/Finish times
* Assessing Penalties in Schedules
* Defining Match Referees in Schedules
