Before any [Scheduling](tmx_tournament_schedule.html) can occur, __Court Locations__ must be defined. This is a fairly simple process.

Fields in __Yellow__ are required.  The table below describes the attributes of each Court Location.

| Field | Definition |
|-------|--------|
| Abbr. | The court abbreviation is used at the top of schedule columns  |
| Name  | Not currently used |
| Address | Not currently used |
| Courts | The number of courts at this location |
| Court IDs | (Optional) A comma separated list of court identifiers |

{% include tip.html content="Court IDs can be used to change the order of courts on the Schedule." %}
