## Open Source Tennis

CourtHive is an Open Source / Open Data initiative to develop applications for Tennis which are affordable, accessible, and which promote the emergence of standards for the representation of data related to tennis.

CourtHive hosts a number of applications.  At present these include:
* [CourtHive/TMX](https://courthive.com/tmx) - a Tournament Management application specifically for tennis
* [CourtHive/Live](https://courthive.com/Live) - a client for viewing tournament schedules, draws and live scores
* [CourtHive/Mobile](https://courthive.com/mobile) - a mobile application for tracking tennis matches
* CourtHive Scores - a private client app to share with friends/family who want to view point-by-point detail of matches which are being broadcast live

Significant portions of CourtHive projects are now or *__will soon__* be available on GitHub [TennisVisuals](https://github.com/TennisVisuals){:target="_ blank"} and [CourtHive](https://github.com/CourtHive){:target="_ blank"}.

## Tournament Management

[CourtHive/TMX](https://courthive.com/tmx) is an open platform for Tennis Tournament Management; it is implemented as a [Progressive Web App](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_Web_Apps){:target="_ blank"} and runs in Chrome, Firefox and Opera, even when there is no internet connection.

TMX is designed to work standalone or to integrate with existing player registration and ranking systems.

## Eyes On Court

Part of the vision of the CourtHive ecosystem is that anyone who is present at a tennis event can contribute in some way to enhancing the tournament experience.  

[CourtHive/Mobile](https://courthive.com/mobile) was an early experiment in live broadcasting of a single tennis match that will be greatly expanded in the future as it is integrated with the [CourtHive/TMX](https://courthive.com/tmx) and [CourtHive/Live](https://courthive.com/Live).

__Crowdsourced scoring__ (with geofencing) can enable more efficient scheduling.

The __Mobile Referee__ capabilities of [CourtHive/TMX](https://courthive.com/tmx) are also intended to allow tournament managers and referees to spend less time in their offices and more time court side.
